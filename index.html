<center><h2>Education and early Life</h2></center>
 <p align="justify">After attending various schools in Bombay, <b>Tata finished high school in New York City in 1955</b>. He then progressed to Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, where he earned a B.S. (1962) in architecture before returning to India to work. He acquired his business training on the job, gaining experience in a number of Tata Group businesses, and was named director in charge (1971) of one of them, the National Radio and Electronics Co. <b>He became chairman of Tata Industries</b> a decade later, and in 1991 he succeeded his uncle, J.R.D. Tata, as chairman of Tata Sons, the parent company of the Tata GroupRatan Tata was a member of a prominent family of Indian industrialists and philanthropists, credited with pioneering much of the country’s industrial establishments and practices. <mark>His great-grandfather Jamsetji Tata founded the Tata Group in 1868</mark>—the businesses under this umbrella, including Tata Steel, played a key nation-building role when India achieved independence from British rule in 1947. The Tata Group was later expanded by Ratan Tata’s uncle J.R.D. Tata, who founded prominent subsidiaries such as Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors, and Tata Salt. Among the pioneering achievements of the Tata Group were the establishment of the iconic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel (1903, Bombay [now Mumbai]), India’s first hotel with electricity, and the founding of Air India (1932) as well as the country’s first indigenous cosmetics brand, Lakmé (1952).</p>

 <h2>Carrer at Tata Group</h2>
 <p align="justify">Ratan Tata joined the Tata Group in 1962, initially working at Tata Steel. His journey through various roles within the organization equipped him with a comprehensive understanding of the conglomerate's diverse operations. In 1991, <b>he took over as chairman of the Tata Group, a pivotal moment that marked the beginning of a transformative era. Under his leadership, the Tata Group expanded its global footprint</b>, acquiring several international companies, including Jaguar Land Rover and Corus Steel. His strategic vision helped the group diversify into new sectors, including information technology, telecommunications, and consumer goods.Ratan Tata became chairman of Tata Sons at a crucial period of India’s growth story: the liberalization of its economy. His ascent was impeded by stiff resistance from existing senior leadership. He consolidated power by implementing a retirement age policy, changing reporting structures, and terminating certain executives. Tata aggressively sought to expand the conglomerate, and increasingly he focused on globalizing its businesses. In 2000 the group acquired London-based Tetley Tea for $431.3 million, and in 2004 it purchased the truck-manufacturing operations of South Korea’s Daewoo Motors for $102 million. <b>Tata Steel completed the biggest corporate takeover by an Indian company when it acquired the giant Anglo-Dutch steel manufacturer Corus Group for $11.3 billion in 2007</b>. The following year Tata oversaw Tata Motors’ purchase of the elite British car brands Jaguar and Land Rover from the Ford Motor Company. The $2.3 billion deal marked the largest-ever acquisition by an Indian automotive firm.
In December 2012 Tata retired as chairman of the Tata Group. He briefly served as interim chairman beginning in October 2016 following the ouster of his successor, Cyrus Mistry. Tata returned to retirement in January 2017 when Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the Tata Group</p>
<h2>Air India and Ratan Tata’s Revival Journey</h2>
<p align="justify">Air India, originally founded as Tata Airlines by J. R. D. Tata in 1932, grew into India’s flagship carrier before being nationalized in 1953 
<b> In a historic move, the Tata Group, led by Ratan Naval Tata as Chairman Emeritus, reacquired Air India in October 2021 through its subsidiary Talace Pvt Ltd for ₹18,000 crore</b> (approx. $2.4 billion), along with ₹15,300 crore of its debt 
Following the takeover in January 2022, Air India began a significant transformation with an ambitious fleet modernization program—including large orders for Airbus and Boeing jets—and a cultural overhaul focused on performance, service, and younger talent 
Ratan Tata himself welcomed passengers with a personal onboard voice message, saying: “…we are excited to work together to make Air India the airline of choice in terms of passenger comfort and service” 
 Under his guidance the airline is merging its multiple subsidiaries—including Vistara,<b> Air India Express, and AirAsia India—into a unified, service-oriented group 
Despite early challenges—such as a major cabin crew sick-out in May 2024</b>, persistent labor issues, and a tragic Boeing 787 crash in June 2025—Tata Group continues to invest heavily in upgrading infrastructure, fleet, and service standards under Campbell Wilson’s leadership 
 Ratan Tata’s unwavering vision remains central to rebuilding Air India’s legacy and competitiveness on the global stage.</p>
